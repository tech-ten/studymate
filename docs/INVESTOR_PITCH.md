# StudyMate

## One-liner

**We're building the Duolingo for Australian primary school tutoring—AI-powered, curriculum-aligned, 95% cheaper than human tutors.**

---

## The Problem

Australian parents spend **$7 billion annually** on private tutoring. The average family pays $200-400/month for tutors who:

- Can't scale 1:1 attention across subjects
- Don't align with what schools actually teach
- Are inaccessible to 80% of families on cost alone

Meanwhile, 40% of Year 5 students are below proficiency in numeracy (NAPLAN 2024).

**Parents are desperate for help but priced out of solutions.**

---

## The Solution

StudyMate delivers unlimited AI tutoring for $5-12/month:

| What we do | How it works |
|------------|--------------|
| **Curriculum-aligned content** | Maps directly to Victorian VCAA codes—parents see exactly which school standards their child masters |
| **Adaptive AI tutor** | Responds at the child's year level, Australian context, unlimited questions |
| **Progress visibility** | Parents track accuracy, streaks, and weak areas in real-time |
| **Gamification** | XP, badges, streaks—kids actually want to practice |

**We replace $400/month tutors with a $5/month app.**

---

## Why Now

Three converging forces:

1. **LLM costs collapsed** — GPT-4 quality responses now cost <$0.001 per interaction via Groq's free tier
2. **Post-COVID tutoring boom** — Market grew 35% since 2020, parents now expect digital solutions
3. **NAPLAN pressure** — Government testing creates urgency; parents need targeted practice

## Why Us

**Founder**: Tendai Mudavanhu
- Parent of three primary school kids (direct customer insight)
- Was paying $320/month for Kumon for two kids—built this to solve his own problem
- Solutions Architect with full-stack engineering and AWS/AI experience
- Built and deployed entire platform solo

> *"My son couldn't keep up with James An, while Kumon was too simplified with a slow, fixed pace. I built Grade My Child so he could learn at his own speed while still covering the full curriculum."*
