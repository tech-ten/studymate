## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

| Feature | Free ChatGPT | AgentsForm |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Curriculum alignment | Generic | Victorian VCAA codes |
| Progress tracking | None | Per-child, per-section |
| Structured learning | Random Q&A | Strands → Chapters → Sections |
| Parent visibility | None | Dashboard with streaks, accuracy |

| Safety | Minimal | Child-safe, guardrailed |

**ChatGPT is a tool. AgentsForm is a learning system.**

## Founder Story

> "I was paying $160/month for Kumon for two kids. Just worksheets at a fixed pace—no AI, no personalisation.
>
> I tried James An College too, but one of my sons couldn't keep up with the group pace because his English was behind. He needed to learn at his own speed while still covering curriculum requirements.
>
> So I built this. AI-powered, curriculum-aligned, self-paced. The service is essentially free to run—subscriptions just cover AI costs."

This is the proposition: **Replace $160-400/month tutoring with a $5-12/month AI alternative that adapts to each child.**
