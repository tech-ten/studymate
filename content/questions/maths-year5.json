      "options": ["54", "56", "58", "64"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "7 × 8 = 56. A good trick: 7 × 8 = 56 (5, 6, 7, 8 in order!)"

      "options": ["62", "72", "82", "68"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "12 × 6 = 72. Break it down: 10×6=60, 2×6=12, then 60+12=72"

      "options": ["72", "81", "90", "99"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "9 × 9 = 81. The nines trick: hold up 9 fingers, put down finger 9. Left: 8, Right: 1 = 81!"

      "options": ["6", "7", "8", "9"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "72 ÷ 9 = 8. Division is the opposite of multiplication: 9 × 8 = 72"

      "options": ["⅓", "¼", "They are equal", "Cannot compare"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "⅓ is bigger than ¼. When the top number is the same, smaller bottom = bigger fraction!"
