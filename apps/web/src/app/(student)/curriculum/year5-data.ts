When we count beyond thousands, we enter the world of really big numbers! Let's explore how our place value system works with these large numbers.

## What is Place Value?

Every digit in a number has a special position that tells us its value. Think of it like assigned seats in a cinema - each seat has a specific spot!

| Hundred Thousands | Ten Thousands | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|------|------|
| 100,000          | 10,000        | 1,000     | 100      | 10   | 1    |

## Reading Large Numbers

Let's read the number **347,582**:
- **3** hundred thousands = 300,000
- **4** ten thousands = 40,000
- **7** thousands = 7,000
- **5** hundreds = 500
- **8** tens = 80
- **2** ones = 2

We say: "Three hundred and forty-seven thousand, five hundred and eighty-two"

## The Comma Rule

We use commas to separate groups of three digits from the right. This makes big numbers easier to read!

## Ordering Large Numbers

When comparing large numbers, start from the left and compare digit by digit.`,

Understanding factors and multiples helps us see how numbers are connected to each other!

## What are Factors?

**Factors** are numbers that divide evenly into another number with no remainder.

**Example:** What are the factors of 12?
- 1 × 12 = 12 ✓
- 2 × 6 = 12 ✓
- 3 × 4 = 12 ✓

So the factors of 12 are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12**

### Finding Factors - The Pair Method

Start with 1 and work your way up, finding pairs. Stop when your pairs start repeating!

## What are Multiples?

**Multiples** are what you get when you multiply a number by 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

**Example:** Multiples of 5: **5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30...**

## The Connection

If 3 is a **factor** of 12, then 12 is a **multiple** of 3. They're like two sides of the same coin!`,

              content: `# Addition and Subtraction Strategies

When working with larger numbers, using smart strategies makes calculations faster and more accurate.

## Mental Strategies

**1. Compensation Strategy**
Add or subtract a friendly number, then adjust.
- 456 + 99 = 456 + 100 - 1 = 555
- 823 - 98 = 823 - 100 + 2 = 725

**2. Splitting Strategy**
Break numbers into place value parts.
- 345 + 234 = (300 + 200) + (40 + 30) + (5 + 4) = 579

**3. Jump Strategy**
Use a number line mentally, jumping by easy amounts.
- 567 + 240: Start at 567, jump +200 = 767, jump +40 = 807

## Written Strategies

**Vertical Addition**
Line up place values and add column by column, regrouping when needed.

**Vertical Subtraction**
Line up place values and subtract, borrowing when needed.

## Estimation

Round numbers first to check your answer is reasonable.

When numbers get bigger, we need smart strategies to multiply them!

## The Expanded Method (Partitioning)

Break the number into parts:

**347 × 6 = ?**
- 300 × 6 = 1,800
- 40 × 6 = 240
- 7 × 6 = 42
- Total: 1,800 + 240 + 42 = **2,082**

## Mental Strategies

### Doubling and Halving
- 25 × 16 = 50 × 8 = 100 × 4 = **400**

### Using Known Facts
- 99 × 7 = (100 × 7) - 7 = 700 - 7 = **693**

### Breaking Apart
- 15 × 12 = 15 × 10 + 15 × 2 = 150 + 30 = **180**`,

Sometimes when we divide, things don't split evenly. That's where remainders come in!

## What is a Remainder?

When you share 17 lollies among 5 friends:
- Each friend gets 3 lollies (5 × 3 = 15)
- There are 2 lollies left over
- We write: **17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 2** or **17 ÷ 5 = 3 r 2**

## What Do Remainders Mean in Real Life?

**1. Ignore the remainder:** "How many full cartons?" → Just use the quotient

**2. Round up:** "How many buses needed?" → Add 1 if there's a remainder

**3. The remainder IS the answer:** "How many left over?" → Use the remainder`,

              content: `# Order of Operations

When a calculation has more than one operation, we need rules to know which to do first.

## The Rules (BODMAS/BIMDAS)

**B** - Brackets first
**O/I** - Orders/Indices (powers, roots)
**DM** - Division and Multiplication (left to right)
**AS** - Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

## Examples

**Example 1:** 3 + 4 × 2
- Multiply first: 4 × 2 = 8
- Then add: 3 + 8 = 11

**Example 2:** (3 + 4) × 2
- Brackets first: 3 + 4 = 7
- Then multiply: 7 × 2 = 14

**Example 3:** 20 ÷ 4 + 3 × 2
- Division: 20 ÷ 4 = 5
- Multiplication: 3 × 2 = 6
- Addition: 5 + 6 = 11

## Why Brackets Matter

Brackets change the order! They tell us "do this first".
- 5 + 3 × 2 = 5 + 6 = 11
- (5 + 3) × 2 = 8 × 2 = 16`,

## Understanding Unit Fractions

A **unit fraction** has 1 as its numerator: ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅕, ⅙...

**Important rule:** The LARGER the denominator, the SMALLER the fraction!

Think about it: If you share a pizza among more people, each person gets a smaller piece.

So: **½ > ⅓ > ¼ > ⅕ > ⅙ > ⅐ > ⅛**

## Comparing Fractions with Same Denominators

When denominators are the same, just compare numerators:
- ⅗ vs ⅖ → 3 > 2, so **⅗ > ⅖**

## Using Benchmarks

Compare fractions to ½:
- Is ³⁄₈ more or less than ½? → ½ = ⁴⁄₈, and 3 < 4, so **³⁄₈ < ½**`,

              content: `# Adding and Subtracting Fractions

When adding or subtracting fractions, the key is having the same denominator.

## Same Denominators

When denominators are the same, just add or subtract the numerators:
- ²⁄₅ + ¹⁄₅ = ³⁄₅
- ⁵⁄₈ - ²⁄₈ = ³⁄₈

## Different Denominators

Find a common denominator first:
- ½ + ¼ = ²⁄₄ + ¼ = ³⁄₄
- ⅓ + ⅙ = ²⁄₆ + ⅙ = ³⁄₆ = ½

## Mixed Numbers

Convert to improper fractions or work with whole numbers separately:
- 1½ + 2¼ = 1²⁄₄ + 2¼ = 3³⁄₄

## Simplifying Answers

Always simplify your answer if possible:
- ⁴⁄₈ = ½
- ⁶⁄₉ = ⅔`,

Fractions, decimals, and percentages are different ways to show the same amount!

## Common Conversions

| Fraction | Decimal | Percentage |
|----------|---------|------------|
| ½        | 0.5     | 50%        |
| ¼        | 0.25    | 25%        |

| ⅒        | 0.1     | 10%        |

## Converting Fractions to Decimals

Divide the numerator by the denominator:
- ¾ = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75
- ⅖ = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4

## Converting Decimals to Fractions

Use place value:
- 0.5 = ⁵⁄₁₀ = ½
- 0.25 = ²⁵⁄₁₀₀ = ¼

## Percentages

Percent means "per 100":
- 50% = ⁵⁰⁄₁₀₀ = ½ = 0.5
- 25% = ²⁵⁄₁₀₀ = ¼ = 0.25`,

              content: `# Understanding Decimals

Decimals are another way to show parts of a whole number, just like fractions!

## Place Value in Decimals

| Ones | . | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths |
|------|---|--------|------------|-------------|
| 1    | . | 0.1    | 0.01       | 0.001       |

## Comparing Decimals

**Golden Rule:** Line up the decimal points, then compare from left to right!

**Example:** Which is larger, 3.45 or 3.5?
- 3.45
- 3.50 (add a zero to help compare)
- Compare: 4 < 5, so **3.5 > 3.45**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ "3.45 is bigger because it has more digits"
✓ Compare place values, not number of digits!`,
              keyPoints: [
                'Each place value is 10 times smaller as you move right',
                'Line up decimal points when comparing',
                'Add trailing zeros to help compare (0.5 = 0.50 = 0.500)',

              content: `# Multiplying and Dividing Decimals

When we multiply or divide decimals by powers of 10, the decimal point moves!

## Multiplying by 10, 100, 1000

The decimal point moves RIGHT:
- × 10: move 1 place right (2.5 × 10 = 25)
- × 100: move 2 places right (2.5 × 100 = 250)
- × 1000: move 3 places right (2.5 × 1000 = 2500)

## Dividing by 10, 100, 1000

The decimal point moves LEFT:
- ÷ 10: move 1 place left (25 ÷ 10 = 2.5)
- ÷ 100: move 2 places left (25 ÷ 100 = 0.25)
- ÷ 1000: move 3 places left (25 ÷ 1000 = 0.025)

## Multiplying Decimals by Whole Numbers

Multiply as if there's no decimal, then put the decimal point back:
- 2.4 × 3 = (24 × 3) ÷ 10 = 72 ÷ 10 = 7.2`,

These three measurements tell us different things about shapes!

## Perimeter

**Perimeter** = the distance around the outside of a shape

For a rectangle: **Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)**

## Area

**Area** = the space inside a 2D shape (measured in square units)

For a rectangle: **Area = length × width**

## Volume

**Volume** = the space inside a 3D shape (measured in cubic units)

For a rectangular prism (box): **Volume = length × width × height**

An angle is formed when two lines meet at a point. We measure angles in degrees (°).

## Types of Angles

- **Acute Angle** (Sharp!): Less than 90°
- **Right Angle** (Square corner): Exactly 90°
- **Obtuse Angle** (Wide): Between 90° and 180°
- **Straight Angle**: Exactly 180°
- **Reflex Angle**: Between 180° and 360°

Probability tells us how likely something is to happen, measured from 0 to 1.

## The Probability Scale

- **0** = Impossible (will never happen)
- **½** = Even chance (equally likely to happen or not)
- **1** = Certain (will definitely happen)

## Writing Probability as Fractions

**Probability = Number of ways event can happen / Total number of possible outcomes**

## Example: Rolling a Die

**P(rolling a 4) = 1/6** (1 way to get 4, 6 total outcomes)
**P(even number) = 3/6 = 1/2** (3 even numbers: 2, 4, 6)`,
